## Purpose of this lib
- I will be constructing a variety of data structures that I can use in production applications. 
## Project Goals
- Each Data Structure should include
[] Documentation on each of their methods
[] That documentation should include the time and space complexity of the methods
### Implemented Data Structures
#### Stack(Implemented with an array)
"""
/**
 * 
 * @@ METHODS Implemented with an array
 * push-- This operation adds an element at the top of a stack
 * pop-- This operation removes the topmost element of a stack
 * peek-- This operation returns the element at the top of the stack
 * isEmpty--This method returns a bool that returns true if empty else false
 * search(element)-- This method searches for a value in the stack and if it exists
